# QuickStash

A mod that uses _Compulsively Count_ on all nearby stashes with 1 click.  
Default key is G.

Note this is both a client and server mod.

### Installation

- Install [BepInEx](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_V_Rising/)
- Extract _quick_stash.dll_ into _(VRising folder)/BepInEx/plugins_
- Extract _quick_stash.dll_ into _(VRising folder)/VRising_Server/BepInEx/plugins_

### Configuration

After running the game once, the config files will be generated.

- Update client config in _(VRising folder)/BepInEx/config/quick_stash.cfg_
- Update server config in _(VRising folder)/VRising_Server/BepInEx/config/quick_stash.cfg_

### Troubleshooting

- If the mod only works when a stash is open, it is because the server part of the mod is not installed. There has been reported issues with this in singleplayer. Unfortunately the only fix I have found for now is to run a dedicated server instead of running singleplayer.
